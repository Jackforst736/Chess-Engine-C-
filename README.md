# Chess-Engine-C-
Basic Chess Engine written in C++. Uses bitboards as the foundation, engine isn't fully finished. Will update in the future.

The main idea behind using bitboards is to use them to represent all twelve pieces, from white pawn to black king, aswell as occupancies for white pieces, black pieces and both pieces. This is very common in chess programming, so was plenty of helpful resources online. 

The project was created because I am both interested in chess and programming and so thought it would be an interesting excercise to expland my knowlege of both subjects. 

I plan on finishing this project over the next two or so weeks, I am currently doing mid semester exams so a bit busy with that. I will then focus on some other projects and then in the future would love to come back to this and implement some machine learning.
